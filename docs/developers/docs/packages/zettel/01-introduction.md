The [Zettelkasten method](https://arantespp.com/zettel/zettelkasten), which the package implements, is a system for organizing and connecting notes in a way that allows for deep thinking and creativity. By providing features such as flashcard and graph data, the Zettel package not only helps you organize your ideas but also provides you with a means to actively engage with and explore their thoughts. Ultimately, the goal of the Zettel package is to empower you to cultivate your own intellectual growth and development through the creation and management of your own digital gardens.
